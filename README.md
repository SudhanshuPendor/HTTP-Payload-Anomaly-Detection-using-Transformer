# HTTP-Payload-Anomaly-Detection-using-Transformer
This project applies a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with self-attention to detect anomalies in HTTP payloads. It aims to improve intrusion detection by classifying payloads as normal or malicious based on sequential character patterns in the data.
